## ARCs
### Code capsules (aka. workflows)

All programmatic components of an ARC should go here, in the form of code and environment.

`/codecaps/<yourCodeCapsuleName>/`
: folder for code and its environment (workflow specifications), contains all files needed to specify a workflow. Also packages and other includes needed should go here.
