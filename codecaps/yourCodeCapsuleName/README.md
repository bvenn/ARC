# ARCs

## ARC directory structure

All programmatic components of an ARC should go here, in the form of code and envirunment.

`/codecaps/<yourCodeCapsuleName>/`
: folder for code and its environment (workflow specifications), contains all files needed to specify a workflow. Also packages and other includes needed should go here.
